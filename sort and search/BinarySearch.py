'''
Given an array of integers nums which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer target, write a function to search target in nums. If target exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return -1.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 9
Output: 4
Explanation: 9 exists in nums and its index is 4
'''
class Solution:
    def search(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        low=0
        high=len(nums)-1
        while(low<=high):
            mid=(low+high)//2

            if(nums[mid]==target):
                return mid
            elif(nums[mid]<target):
                low=mid+1
            else:
                high=mid-1
        return -1
